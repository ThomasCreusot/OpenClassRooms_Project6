# OpenClassRooms_Project6
Develop an user interface for your Python web application


# Project presentation
The present project is the sixth one of the training course *Python Application Developer*, offered by OpenClassRooms and aims to *Develop an user interface for your Python web application*.


The main goal is to develop an **web application** wich allows to **visualise a movie classification**.

This application must:
- get the movies data from the **[API OCMovies-API](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR)** with ajax requests
- display these data on a web interface :
- - The best movie, according to the imdb score
- - The category "Best movies": 7 bests movies (all categories combined)
- - Three categories (e.g. : action, drama, etc.): 7 bests movies
- display a modal window when the user clicks on the button related to the best movie or a movie picture
- be compliant with a given design (OpenClassRooms project)


Note: update of data must be automated.
Note2: vanilla Javascript only.
